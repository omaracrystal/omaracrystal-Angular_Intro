# Angular Intro

## What we're covering

1. `ng-app` - bootstraps angular
1. `ng-controller` - defines where (start/end) controller lives in the HTML; links back to the controller in the modules
1. `ng-click` - "click" event (akin `on` `click` in jQuery )
1. `ng-repeat` - used to iterated (akin to a `forEach`)
1. `$scope` - binds values/variables to the view
1. SETTING/GETTING an angular module - angular code lives in the view/model
1. CREATING a controller - defines what gets bound to the view via `$scope`
